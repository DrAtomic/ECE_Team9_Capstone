Track progress
– E-mail sent to teammates, manager/project leader
– Concise!
– What tasks you accomplished
– Problems encountered and how you solved them
– Problems remaining and thoughts on possible solutions
– Action plan for the following week

Share what you’re working on
– Task should relate to project schedule/task assigned
– Allow others to assess impact of your progress (or lack of it) on them
– Someone may have some useful input, contact, resource, suggestion
– Someone may need something from you in a different order
“could you do X first so that I can…”

Early warning of problems/issues
– Do your work, but don’t wallow in a problem too long – get help early (no ego!)
– Escalate problems (someone else can help solve them – obtain resources, etc.)

Plan/commit for immediate next steps and alerts others (motivation)
– “Oh, Susan’s going to need my spec by next week if she’s to remain on schedule”

Binning activities:
easy, medium, hard

Local solution for now.

Simple web interface feasibility?
