AI teaching assistant.  Facial recognition and behavioral processing.

Elevaor Pitch:
Our sponsor, Christof Teuscher is an Alan Turing enthusiast and avid runner.  His proposal, “An AI-based Teaching Practices and Classroom Activities Tool to Improve Education” is an automated tool that uses AI to analyze student and teaching behaviors using a simple recording device, like a cell phone.  That analysis will include student interaction and presented teaching materials.  We will deliver a functional prototype using a cell phone to record and analyze full-length class sessions.  We are also to deliver relevant documentation.  We expect to encounter COVID related collaboration issues and we are concerned about accidental mission creeping technological overreach.
