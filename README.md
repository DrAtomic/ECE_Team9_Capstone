AI teaching assistant.  Facial recognition and behavioral processing.

Elevaor Pitch:
Our sponsor, Christof Teuscher is an Alan Turing enthusiast and avid runner.  His proposal, “An AI-based Teaching Practices and Classroom Activities Tool to Improve Education” is an automated tool that must use AI to analyze student and teaching behaviors using a simple recording device, like a cell phone.  That analysis should include student interaction and presented teaching materials.  It may also consider the teacher's presentation style.  We must deliver a functional prototype using a cell phone to record and analyze full-length class sessions.  We also must deliver relevant documentation.  We expect to encounter COVID related collaboration issues and we are concerned about accidental feature creeping technological overreach.
